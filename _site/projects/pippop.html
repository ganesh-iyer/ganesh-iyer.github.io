      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>Our investigation began with seeing how many users continue to use methods like paper/pen, manually dialling numbers or business cards to exchange contact information with those they meet in person. On conducting contextual inquiries at career fairs and reunions, our key insight was that business cards were mostly <span class = "key-term">ineffective</span>, <span class = "key-term">wasteful</span> and <span class = "key-term">unrequited</span>. This project was also our chance to understand why previous interventions like Bump, Cardflick, Jiffy et al have not become ubiquitous.</p>

        <p>We clustered our findings from the contextial inquiries into similar <span class = "key-term">type</span> of concerns, desires and behaviors. In addition to this we also clustered our findings <span class = "key-term">over space</span> - where the findings happened physically, and <span class = "key-term">over time</span> - when they happened over an interaction timeline. In the latter case, we discovered that <span class ="key-term">users attempted to exchange contacts long after their interaction with someone!</span></p>

        <p>To explore this opportunity, our next step was to test out the waters through a baseline paper prototype. Our intention to use mobile phones was to target a greater integration into the potential market. This allowed us some obvious value-adds - other social networks that users might be a part of already.</p><p>We deduced that seamlessness may have been a worry for our users during their in-person experiences. So the main question we tried to answer through these paper prototypes was - <span class = "key-term">is there value in collecting<span class = "project-special">*</span> contact information without taking your phone off your pocket? </span></p>
        <p class = "footnote"><span class = "project-special">*</span> - At the time, the team were aware of concerns related to user security. However, we wanted to use roleplaying as a way to nip this idea in the bud if we needed to.</p>

      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>To avoid the phone collecting everyone's contacts as the user pass through a room, we designed a filter such that only those contacts will be collected with whom the user has been <span class = "key-term">close to</span>. From the think aloud activity with a handful of users, we realized that this needed another tweak. That only those with whom the user has spent a <span class = "key-term">certain x minutes of time</span> will show up in the user's list.</p>
        <p>In the second iteration, we built a <a href = "https://marvelapp.com/99d5h3/screen/8491027" target="_blank">mid-fidelity prototype on Marvel</a> (and another one on Justinmind) for specific use cases - viewing contacts collected over a period of time (which also included a map view), viewing nearby contacts, and understanding what kind of information is visible to these users and is shared with them. Seeing that having two modes of exchanging contacts is worthy of further exploration, we named this idea <span class = "key-term">PipPop (Phone-in-Pocket, Phone-off-Pocket)</span>.</p>

      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>To inform the design of the final prototype to be delivered, we conducted a heuristic evaluation with other designers in the class and among ourselves to identify key issues. Key among those were the <span class = "key-term">predicted reactions to something new spanning from delight through embarrassment to awkwardness</span> - particularly in cases where users wanted to exercise the option of not sharing their information. Considering that most of the uncertainty was around the newness of the app, easing the lack of match between system and real world also became an important priority.</p>
        <p>To speed up the prototyping process, we created UI resources in Illustrator and used Framer Studio to run through specific use cases. To establish consistency, I took the responsibility of devising UI guidelines as shown in the example below. Also, to save time I created icons and Illustrator templates for others in the team to modify for their own use cases.

      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>For situations where the user pulls out her phone to exchange contact information, we modified the interface to display only the single nearest user rather than 3 contacts. In situations where the phone stays in the pocket, we changed the display of people met to a list rather than a grid because the number of pictures can get overwhelming. We based our navigation model on how people linguistically remembered a meeting; the entry point of recall was <span class = "key-term">where</span> they met someone.</p>
        <p>We also allowed the user to specify which profile - professional or personal - to share in either situations with an option to configure a default in the settings. Owing to the short timeline, the map view, annotations and attachments - where a user can attach a resume or a portfolio to their profile were deemed out of scope.</p>

      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>We planned an experiment with three key tasks - exchanging contact information one-on-one, meeting a person and requesting their contact information at a later time, and understanding how users interpreted icons in matters related to visibility of their information. We completed the experiments with 10 participants, the control-experiment split being 50-50.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, our prototype performed very well compared with methods that our participants typically use to accomplish the same kinds of tasks. Both in-pocket and off-pocket interventions received high qualitative ratings and were performed fast. Admittedly, the experiments were limited in scope and execution and likely did not capture <em>all</em> aspects of the user's experience.

      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>Affinity diagramming is typically used to cluster similar notes together. In this problem space however, since the nature of interactions can depend so heavily on the social context as well as are transient and precious, grouping the notes by space and time led us to an entirely unexplored region of user interactions.</p>
        <p>To come up with ideas, not only did we play around research methods, but also we modeled a futuristic technology-agnostic scenario in which we imagined a utopian contact exchange scenario. We then extrapolated these ideas backwards to the present day.</p>
        <p>Why the paper prototype was extremely crucial to our process was because despite their tangible similarities with business cards, they were effective enough to simulate new tricky technological features and consequently, to provoke security and ethical concerns.</p>
        <p>While software like Marvel are extremely useful in building clickable prototypes very quickly, I felt it would have been even better had they had a framework for case-switching through multiple cases. I later stumbled upon Proto.io during my internship which was great for case-switching and using variables!</p>
