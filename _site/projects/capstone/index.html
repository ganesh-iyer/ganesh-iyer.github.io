To be able to explain design issues in simpler terms helped us come up with simpler solutions that were impactful across the entire interface.

<p><strong>Brief:</strong> Design and prototype a new interface for a <a href="http://muziboo.com/" class="underlined-link" target="blank">
music-sharing website
<span class="fa fa-external-link no-underline"></span></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Web client for Desktop.</p>

<p><strong>Project Background:</strong> This was a Capstone/Thesis Project accomplished in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Bachelor of Design (B.Des) degree from the Department of Design at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India.</p>

<p><em>Muziboo</em> <a href="http://www.nextbigwhat.com/muziboo-shuts-puts-blame-music-industry-dmca-297/" class="underlined-link" target="blank">
was
<span class="fa fa-external-link no-underline"></span></a> a website where users could login and upload home-made music and also provide a platform for other users to discover, share and comment on independent home-made music.</p>

</span><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>Process:</strong> The three key steps – user research, human-centered design and evaluation with people – were done iteratively throughout the project whenever applicable (see sketch above).</p>

<p>The two designers in the team under the guidance of our project guide had split the project timeline into two phases. Phase I (from August 2009 to December 2009) involved gathering of research findings, competitive analysis, usability evaluation of the website, interpretation of findings into tangible UI requirements and the formulating of a design brief and direction.</p>

<p>Phase II (January 2010 to May 2010) involved the ideation phase from the brief and iteratively testing paper prototypes with the users and designing of the final functional prototype on Axure Pro, complete with visual design and testing the prototype with the users.</p>

<p>Starting from a user survey conducted globally by the client, we went on to analyze how competitors organized data. The survey also suggested that some of the competitors offered a richer experience and on conducting heuristic evaluations on these interfaces, we found that <strong>they were in violation of most of the current interpretations of Nielsen’s heuristics</strong>. This suggested to us that we needed to look at our redesign process through a new lens and we <strong>reformulated a new set of heuristics for our process</strong>. These heuristics form the core of our

that we had presented at IndiaHCI 2010, IIT Bombay.</p>

<span class="figure-description">

</span><br /><br /></p>

<p>With these new heuristics in mind, a usage analysis was carried out by testing these interfaces through similar tasks. The 10 participating users were from different nationalities and cultures. Remote testing, whenever required, was carried out through GoToMeeting.</p>

<p>The main problem was <strong>the cumbersome navigation routes in place to achieve even simple tasks</strong>. A design brief was formulated to solve these problems while also leaving room for innovation on how the redesigned interface could be used.</p>

<span class="figure-description">
<strong>Fig:</strong>  IA was revised based on iteratively testing paper prototypes reflecting the proposed task flows and navigation.
</span><br /><br /></p>

<p>Based on the design brief and the UI issues to be solved, we had drawn task flow diagrams to make the interface cleaner and the navigation flexible. Almost in parallel, we worked on the information architecture. To test the strength of these two concepts, we converted them into paper prototypes and tested it out with the users and came back with corrections and went back to the drawing board as far as these components were concerned.</p>

<p>On finalizing the task flow diagrams and the information architecture, we designed usable wireframes and added some conceptual features like a central music player as part of the header navigation and the concept of tagging a friend at a particular time in a recording. Once these wireframes were well-received by another user test, we set out to translate them into pixel-perfect and working prototypes.</p>

</span><br /><br /></p>

<p>We used <em>Axure Pro</em> to prototype the entire website navigation and used <em>Kuler</em> by Adobe to come up with a color scheme. Using a 12-column grid system, we built the prototypes and prepared them for the final test through a rigorous task-based analysis using an <strong>eye-movement recorder</strong>. This test <strong>showed the vast difference in the clarity and navigation between the current website and the proposed design</strong>.</p>

<p>The entire project was summarized into a book and published by LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, Germany. The monograph can be purchased

<p><strong>Resonsibilities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We had equally split the tasks of analyzing user surveys, literature reviews, conducting heuristic evaluations, iterative tests with the paper prototypes, task-based usage analysis and the tests with the eye movement recorder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being the more experienced writer, I had taken responsibility of first authorship of all the documentation including writing the monograph, thesis report as well as writing and <strong>presenting the paper at IndiaHCI conference in March 2010</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had also prepared the entire working prototype on Axure Pro and also <strong>prepared the task scripts for the user tests</strong>.
<br /><br /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This was the first major redesign project that I had worked on and the key challenge here was iterating under tight deadlines. It was also an important learning experience deciding <strong>when to keep exploring ideas and when to converge onto a single concept</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was Occam’s Razor at play as some of our few, small and simple changes showed massive improvements in our Eye-movement recorder tests. In hindsight, I feel affinity diagramming would have been extremely handy here, but we went about a long-winded way to solve similar problems in multiple places.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was also a regret of not being assertive enough on some of the innovative features that we added to the interface - the central music player and especially, the tagging feature. This was in part due to a greater pressure and emphasis on correcting faults through redesign.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
