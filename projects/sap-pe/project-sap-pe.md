<h3 class = "key-insight">Key Insight</h3>
The synthesis stage of the Design Thinking was a very efficient platform to bring together visions of the product from the perspectives of managers, developers, architects and product owners and how they would have done things differently.

**Brief:** Design a

family of applications
<span class="fa fa-external-link no-underline"></span></a>
for a Project Manager that allows him to monitor and regulate scheduling, logistics and financial aspects of a project.

**Platform:** Web client responsive across tablets, smartphones (iOS and Android) and PC.

**Project Background:** The entire Project Execution product was modularized into 20 applications that each cater to a single use-case within either scheduling, logistics or revenue. By having mobilized each use-case into an app, the dashboard for the product can be split up into individual key performance indicators from each application that would also serve as a portal into that respective application. A similar structure was also being developed for other products.

**Process:** The use-cases were divided among the UX team and concepts were aligned to match the product vision as well as adhere to an overriding central UI guideline library. The applications shown here were the use-cases that *I* had worked upon from ideation to high-fidelity prototypes. The prototypes were made in *Adobe Illustrator*.

We had also performed a rigorous design thinking process wherein my teammate was part of the usability moderation team with the product owners at the client locations while my development scrum master and I led the synthesis of the data collected in Bangalore.

**Resonsibilities:**

* Led detailed discussions with product owners where I interpreted verbal concepts and systems in the SAP-GUI into quick flow diagrams.

* Translated SAP-system GUIs into responsive web equivalents by fusing new platform potential with product functionalities and objectives in the real world.

**Fig:** Led the Design Thinking analysis of customer feedback that was compiled by the offshore team at client locations.
</span><br /><br />

* Being one of the early frontrunners in adhering to the newly accepted central UI design guidelines, my teammate and I formulated UI control requirements based on use-cases relevant to our set of applications. Through discussions, we had then proposed UI solutions that could hold well in other sets of applications that were looking to adhere to this evolving library.

* Provided UI specs as well as tested the final implementations before every release.

* Ensured that the mockups were adherent to the central UI library guidelines at all times through and for reference of other application families looking to comply.

* Translated synthesis of customer feedback into proofs of concepts for future releases.
<br /><br />

**Other Insights:**

* Despite its long development lifecycle, my teammate and I worked in an intensive agile work environment owing to radical UI changes, while, at the same time designing for future releases that incorporate customer feedback. This was a major source of design dilemmas.

* At times, it was difficult to understand if a user's acceptance of terminologies and models from an old interface was considered worthy to retain in a newer design. While newer interpretations on paper could have been better, this was not established through user-testing.

**Product Owner Feedback:**

> Ganesh has proven his ability to quickly understand the business context and use case and to turn rather fuzzy ideas and requirements into concrete and well structured ideas for visualisation and navigation. He made sure to focus on simplicity and usability without dropping any of the mandatory features. Ganesh took full responsibility for his tasks and work while staying an agile team player at the same time.
