Screens where there is a green square to the bottom-right corner of the screen indicate alternative visualizations. Screens having a blue square to the top-right indicate an error scenario. A blue-square at the top-left corner indicates that you can navigate to a previous page wherefrom you can navigate to an error scenario.

**Project Background:**

This non-curricular project was my first time working in the field of Usable Security. I took this up purely because I was convinced that it'll help expand my design understanding.

The Tor Browser is a special software that directs internet traffic through a layered relay system to anonymize a userâ€™s internet activity. The objective of Tor is to protect the personal privacy of users and their freedom to keeping communication confidential from spying parties.

Since the software has such an important responsibility, the browser configuration is layered with the additional complication of choosing relay bridges and configuring local proxy settings. A user can by default, connect without a bridge and proxy. After the first-time use, the browser uses the last successful configuration to connect. In any case, the browser does not connect without the appearance of this configuration screen.

**Process:**

This project was spearheaded by 3 Computer Science PhD students working in the Usable Security Group while I joined as a UX designer midway through their user tests. Design decisions were driven strictly by the insights from the user tests, aided by affinity diagramming. Iterative sketches on paper some of which were also prototyped on *Marvel* helped get multiple concepts into a tangible form quickly. After the team converged onto a narrower set of concepts, I designed the high-fidelity prototypes on *Adobe Illustrator*.

Currently, the prototypes are being modified for another round of usability tests.

**Resonsibilities:**

* I led the affinity diagramming process where the team transcribed screen recordings as well as moderator notes from the user tests onto sticky note clusters. The user tests were conducted solely by the PhD students.

* I have also been responsible for sketching and prototyping multiple solutions to issues discovered in the user tests.
<br /><br />

**Key Insights:**

* Designing for security brought to the fore an important question - should the UI display only that information which the user wants to see? Or should it display everything that is going on under the hood since it is a matter of the user's privacy?

* The field of security has an important overlap with behavioral economics. Our designs derived and implemented principles like paternalistic information asymmetry, size and sequence of choice sets and optimizing hassle factors.

* Balancing effort and reward at every step to evoke an experience of layered security had an important influence on our design decisions.
