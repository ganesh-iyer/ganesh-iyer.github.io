<h3 class = "key-insight">Key Insight</h3>
Detailing a sketch and drafting the information architecture informed each other and hence, were iterative. A key advantage was it brought up hypothetical situations which would enhance or break the model. This investigative approach allowed me to design beyond the brief.

**Brief:** Design a web interface for the non-profit initiative
<a href="http://www.bachinthesubways.org" class="underlined-link" target= "blank">
Bach in the Subways
<span class="fa fa-external-link no-underline"></span></a>,
that enables a more efficient management of performances globally.

**Platform:** Responsive web client.

**Project Background:** Bach in the Subways is an international movement started in New York City by cellist Dale Henderson which sows the seeds for future generations of classical music lovers by generating public interest and excitement for the art form.

Every year on March 21 (Johann Sebastian Bach’s birthday), musicians celebrate *Bach in the Subways Day* by offering free performances of Bach’s music in subways and public spaces around the world.

The project involved setting up a usable interface that would be used by the organizers, volunteers and
participants in self-organizing performances across the globe on that day.

**Process:** To capture the essence of client requirements, the issues discussed were transferred immediately to paper in the form of sketches and the process was repeated a number of times. The quick nature of sketches also gave me freedom to superimpose newer concepts. Once there was a clear architectural idea for the website, I designed the mockups on *Adobe Illustrator* and also proposed concepts that could be used in future editions of *Bach in the Subways Day*.
<br /><br />

**Responsibilities:**

Through iterative sketches and high-fidelity mockups, I had worked with my UX colleague in New York City to generate concepts. I was responsible for creating high-fidelity prototypes and sketching concepts that emerged from regular discussions with my UX colleague.

**Other Insights:**

* The main challenge was to **optimize the balance between control and freedom** - between participants choosing their performance slots (in terms of location and time) and the organizers/volunteers resolving conflicts. This was resolved by integrating online forms with a usable database. This solution was also proposed with the next few editions of the event in mind.

* This project also greatly helped me to avoid overelaborating concepts while presenting them to clients.

**Client Feedback:**

> Ganesh was extremely committed and made himself highly accessible despite extreme time zone differences (New York to Mumbai). The high quality of his mockups were crucial to the project, and Ganesh responded quickly to changes discussed in online meetings with the design sensibilities we needed to move the team in the right direction.

>Ganesh helped develop a concept around developing an interface with hundreds of musicians engaging with the movement from across different parts of the world, which was simultaneously functional and visually hard-hitting.
