**Brief:** Design an interface that helps people exchange contact information in both social and professional environments more seamlessly.

**Platform:** Mobile and tablet. Final design was prototyped on *Framer Studio* for an iPhone 6.

**Duration:** August 2015 to December 2015

**Project Background:**

While newer technologies have permeated various aspects of our lives over the last 20 years, our methods of exchanging contact information are not as rich in experience as it could possibly have been. The experience of exchanging contact information ***in person*** has also been relatively untouched with regards to technological intervention. Our pitch had a foundation in the prevalence of business cards and our contextual inquiries later rendered them pretty much wasteful and unrequited.

While there already have been technological interventions in this area before, (Bump*, CardFlick, Jiffy et al), our team of 4 wanted to understand more clearly why such solutions haven’t become ubiquitous and investigate for ourselves how design decisions emerge from a user-centered process.

**Process:**

Following a user-centered design process was key to some of the project’s important findings and subsequently, had an impact on our design decisions. While the product aimed to overhaul a firmly-rooted status quo, the technological nature of our intervention brings in new issues in terms of privacy and safety. Therefore, we iteratively followed a  user-centered design process for the product to stand any chance of assimilation into the norm.

**Responsibilities:**

The distribution in the tasks considering our various backgrounds, was to ensure that every team member had a strong understanding of the overall UX design process.

* Drove forward the tools component (*Adobe Illustrator*, *Paper-prototyping* and *Marvel*) of the process in terms of both prototyping and advising team members regarding working around the tools and best practices.

* Moderated whiteboard discussions which were used to make important design and experimental decisions as well as to stay aligned to the UX process.

* Co-ordinated the UI guidelines and specifications (using the iOS Human Interface guidelines) for the final prototype to ensure consistency among the various task flows each team member was assigned.

**Key Insights:**

Despite having designed in the past, I learned more and got more out of the design experience **by sticking to the process and not skipping steps**.

* While the affinity diagramming method  is typically used to group similar notes together, we played around with it to also **group by space and by time**. The latter led us to an entirely new problem space and our Phone-in-Pocket idea was the result of this playing around.

* Why the paper prototype was extremely crucial to our process was because the simulation of a tricky technological feature through these quick prototypes was enough to provoke security and ethical concerns.

* Visual design has an important role to play in the design of products where privacy may be an issue. This is one of the reasons why I feel I would be able to design better by grasping the full stack.

* While software like *Marvel* are extremely useful in building clickable prototypes very quickly, I felt it would have been even better had they had a framework for case-switching through multiple cases.

* Fluency with *Illustrator* helped me to make the <a href="https://marvelapp.com/99d5h3" class="underlined-link" target= "blank">

with a greater degree of fidelity than my previous projects. I'm keen on achieving similar success with sketching.

**Evaluator Feedback:**

> You took on an extremely difficult problem this semester, and I'm impressed with how far you've come, and how much you've learned about the problem space.
I'm also impressed with how thorough your prototype was, and how much effort you put into making the experiment feel realistic.
