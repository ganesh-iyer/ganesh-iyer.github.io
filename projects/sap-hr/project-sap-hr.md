This was one of the projects where I used my knowledge in HTML and CSS to resolve UI issues quickly during developer demos.

**Brief:** Design dashboard UI and work flows that cater to the various roles of an HR Professional and/or HR Administrator.

**Platform:** Web clients for tablet and desktop. Unlike the SAP ESS and MSS products, our target users perform their functions in a desktop device.

**Project Background:** The HR Administrator has a set of functions - tasks, processes, actions, discussions, organization, analytics and search - which are to be within quick reach as he signs in for the day.

The target user in the HR Administrator Dashboard in most cases worked on a desktop, so the UIs prior to the redesign were data intensive. The new look however, catered to the manager who also worked on an iPad, hence it became my responsibility to incorporate the font and icon specifications of the new look while making room for the data that the target user was so used to.

The main challenge was that since this was an incremental release for the HR Admin Dashboard, no structural changes were permitted through the UI.

**Process:** The final visual design of the project was the outcome of a rigorous Design Thinking workshop for a dashboard design which targeted

Managers (MSS)
<span class="fa fa-external-link no-underline"></span></a> and <a href="http://www.sap.com/solution/lob/hr/software/employee-self-service/index.html" class="underlined-link" target= "blank">
Employees (ESS)
<span class="fa fa-external-link no-underline"></span></a>. The finalized objective was to redesign flows for HR Admin functions that fit this new-look dashboard design. A single-level navigation was also required, hence flows were designed for each of the individual dashboard components.

**Resonsibilities:**

* I had worked in close sync with an agile scrum development team to drive the entire UX process from ideation through paper sketches to high-fidelity mockups with UI specifications for each individual component of this dashboard.

* Also worked with the Manager and Employee Self-Service team (which had underwent the Design Thinking process to come up with the new Dashboard look) for proposed adjustments that can be made universal for all three kinds of users.

* Before the new UI framework was proposed, I was responsible for providing pixel-perfect UI specifications adherent to the then existing guidelines and test the resulting implementation by the development team. Accessibility tests were also done in addition to testing High Contrast Black (HCB) versions.

* Also played an initial role as a designer in the ideation and visualization of the Organization Visualization application that was incorporated in the Manager Self-service use-case. Having worked on an earlier release of an organization visualization application which was made for the HR Professional, I addressed potential design gaps and loopholes in the seminal version for the manager-oriented application.

* In addition, I was also responsible for directing the icon design (including the RtL icons) as well as raising UI-related IT tickets and ensuring their resolution.

**Other Insights:** In addition to leading the design for the HR Admin team, I had to also establish consistency with the newer ESS and MSS teams. While the newer teams had greater flexibility in terms of design expression, straying away drastically from the design of our recent release was out of the question for us. The constant communication required to make design compromises was painstaking, but invaluable.
