      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>I had designed for 10 applications in the entire Project Execution product family. Some key use cases were - a project manager should be able to have an overview of project progress within one project and across multiple projects, a project manager should be able to view how project milestones have been completed, a project manager should be able to know how delays might affect her project. Shown below is one of our earlier concepts for representing milestones.</p>

      <div class = "project-section-heading"><h2>Approach</h2></div>
      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>Our approach drastically changed after the adoption of the <a href = "http://www.sap.com/product/technology-platform/fiori.html" target="_blank">Fiori UI library</a>. While the previous use cases we were handling differed greatly in appearance, adopting Fiori both freed and constrained our approach. Since our product was one of the early adopters of the library, we were able to propose design of new UI elements that could be used across multiple other products. The adherence to the new library however meant that the previously different representations within Product Execution had to be redrawn - for example, <span class = "key-term">how would apps look like if there were allowed only two levels of navigation?</span></p>

    <div class = "project-section">
      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>My co-designer and I constantly aligned with each other and with other early adopters to make sure that most UI controls have enough flexibility to fit into multiple use cases with little engineering effort. This required us to also be in sync with the engineering team. Another challenge was also to improvize using other existing controls when the proposed UI elements despite critical were not feasible. In the mockup below, we contributed to additional modifications to the bar chart controls.</p>

      <div class = "project-section-text">
        <p>In parallel to our design efforts, our team also conducted a Design Thinking exercise to bring together the whole team to a common understanding. My co-designer was involved with interviewing stakeholders in Germany while I led the synthesis of the insights from the Bangalore office. We mapped various issues using affinity diagramming, clustering based on which part of the project lifecycle did they occur in.</p>

        <p>The redesign into Fiori also gave us an opportunity to rethink business requirements - does it allow us to add or <span class = "key-term">take away</span> features if necessary? For example concept of defaults that I introduced below worked well both in the new UI patterns as well as fulfilled an unexpressed business need.</p>

        <p>In the situation below, I had to make the case for new controls such as a trend analysis chart. This required modifications to the existing line chart library so that it allowed changing the orientation of the axes, allowing tooltips to responsively align themselves since there are likely scenarios of more than 30 milestones in one chart, and also bearing visual similarities to conventional MTA charts.</p>

        <p>Finally, as a result of the design thinking exercise conducted, I had come up with a proof-of-concept that allows a project manager to foresee serious delays in future because of trivial unavailability of resources in the present.

        <p>The synthesis stage of the Design Thinking was a very efficient platform to bring together visions of the product from the perspectives of managers, developers, architects and product owners and how they would have done things differently.
        </p>
        <p>Despite its long development lifecycle, my teammate and I worked in an intensive agile work environment owing to radical UI changes, while, at the same time designing for future releases that incorporate customer feedback. This was a major source of design dilemmas.
        </p>
        <p>At times, it was difficult to understand if a userâ€™s acceptance of terminologies and models from an old interface was considered relevant to retain in a newer design. While newer interpretations on paper could have been better, this was not established through user-testing.
