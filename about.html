    <p>
      My skills span the full-spectrum of design from <strong>information architecture</strong>
      through <strong>wireframes and UX specifications</strong> to <strong>high-fidelity testable prototypes</strong>
      with <strong>pixel-perfect visual design</strong>. I am proficient in conducting <strong>formative and summative
      usability tests</strong> as well as <strong>designing visualizations for data</strong> at various scales.

<span class = "headline-emph">design for it</span>.
I have designed for spaces like enterprise, e-commerce, lifestyle, security, non-profit, and e-learning.
<br /><br />
In an effort to reinvent myself and master the full-stack of design, I'm currently studying Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualization as part of my
