I start with paper to come up with as many design ideas as possible to a use case. I iteratively converge towards a more refined solution and use Sketch, Illustrator, Photoshop, Balsamiq or Figma for wireframes and laying down UX specifications. To create prototypes, I use Proto/Invision, Marvel and Framer Studio.
