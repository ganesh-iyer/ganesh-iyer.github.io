# Ganesh Iyer | Product Designer
(built upwards from a truly bare bones Jekyll starter theme by [Garett Boatman](https://garrettboatman.com/))
Hello,
I'm a Product Designer from the Bay Area currently studying HCI and Data Visualization at UC Berkeley. Coming from a strong UX background, I intend to reinforce my skills by making things more beautiful through a refined visual design sensibility and a greater understanding of front-end development of native and web applications. I am also keen on designing products for AR/VR/MR.

TODO:
1. Make responsive design decision - to hamburger or not.
2. Code project and about page with dummy data
3. Code Resume page with card design
4. Make color decisions for section backgrounds - shylock-dark and 3 more
5. Show cuts for the background when transitioning between sections
6. Make shadow decisions for the backgrounds
7. Show micro-interactions for the nav menu as you scroll
8. Design Favicons


--- later---
1. Figure out meta tags and schemas (schema.org) in your HTML; sigh, include Facebook too
2. Search Engine Optimization
3. Figure out how Garden reduces their website to just 32B. That's just mental.

Done Archive:
1. Logo to appear on the left with designation as you cross the navigation bar. - DONE
2. Menu scrolls upwards from the bottom and then it sticks to the top and stays there. - DONE
3. Get the Medium integration - fuck this. Medium's gonna price you.
