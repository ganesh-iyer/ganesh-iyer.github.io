# Ganesh Iyer | Product Designer

Hello,
I'm a Product Designer from the Bay Area currently studying HCI and Data Visualization at UC Berkeley. Coming from a strong UX background, I intend to reinforce my skills by making things more beautiful through a refined visual design sensibility and a greater understanding of front-end development of native and web applications. I am also keen on designing products for AR/VR/MR.
